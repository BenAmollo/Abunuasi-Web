- content: David Njau is a genius. At least according to me and the long duration I have known him. He has this keen interest in making the world a better place by using mobile technology to change his environment and that of his society. He has done so well in delivering a mobile app "ardhisasa" for spatial data collection and syncing with an existing database. The App can collect spatial data, display on an osm base map and sync to the Database. He delivered the App in record time with more functionalities that had not been envisaged in the ToRs. The guy is a pure genius. i recommend him for any piece of work as far as moblie app development is concerned. He is the real deal. Pure Geniuos.
